						<h3>Are we there yet?</h3>

							Yes, fitout has started we'll be ready for operations in June. We are now accepting applications for Bootstrapper Memberships.</p>
							<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
							<p class="lead">
								This membership is aimed at people who are in the process of bootsrapping a technology company and looking to build a team in Noosa. Bootstrapper membership suits people seeking entrepreneurial support to grow their company, with the Hub team and fellow members providing mentoring, connections to investors and helping them find talent.
							</p>
							<h3>Is this for me?</h3>
							<p class="lead">
								Our aim is to build a culture of fun, creativity and collaboration at the Hub and the early members will play a critical role in setting the tone. We are therefore keen to find members who can make contributions that benefit other tenants as well as the young talent we develop through the Hub's hothouse program.
							</p>
							<p class="lead">
								The Hub, itself, is in startup mode and as an early member you'll be part of its evolution over the next few months as we develop it into a world class environment for technology companies.
